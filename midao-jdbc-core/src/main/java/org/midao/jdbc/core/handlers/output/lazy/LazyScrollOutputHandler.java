 * In order to check if JDBC Driver supports such functionality - please read relevant JDBC driver documentation

 * <p>
 * Scroll supports only one ResultSet due to the fact that some JDBC Drivers close previous ResultSet before returning next one.
 * In cases where multiple ResultSets need to be handled - please use cached or standard(non-scrollable) lazy output.
